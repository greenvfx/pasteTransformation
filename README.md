###pasteTransformation is a tool for fast linking and copy transform values between nodes.

Steps:
* Copy a node with some transformation.
* Select a target node.
* For linking is **SHIFT+V**. For copying is **ALT+V**.
* Done!

Currently supported transfer: 
* Transforms/Trackers -> Tracker4, Tracker3, Transform, Noise, Bezier, GridWarp2, GridWarp3, TransformMasked, Text2  + Roto,  RotoPaint Ð¸ SplineWarp3
* CornerPin2D -> Roto, RotoPaint, SplineWarp3, GridWarp3, CornerPin2D(transform_matrix)(Supported only copying).

You can paste transformation into layers. If you don't select a particular layer then a transformation goes to a Root layer.
